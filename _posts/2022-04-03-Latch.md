# 3-1 Latch

## Introduction to Sequential Circuit

### Combinational Logic Circuit vs. Sequential Logic Circuit

- Combinational Logic Circuit: the output is a function of only the present input
- Sequential Logic Circuit: the output of a sequential device depends not only on the present input but on previous inputs as well. This previous inputs can be remembered by storing them into the memory.

### Latch vs. Flip-Flop

: These two are the memory element types most commonly used in logic circuits

- Latch: a memory element whose excitation inputs control the state of the device
    - Excitation input `1`: a *set* input
    - Excitation input `0`: a *reset* input
- Flip-Flop: a memory element based on latch, but **it has a control input called a *clock***
    - Clock input: this input carries a signal to the flip-flop that triggers a state change in accordance with the flip-flopâ€™s excitation inputs.

## Latches

### SR Latch (S: set, R: reset)
